# Contributing

This project adheres to [Contributor Covenant v2.0][contributor-convenant] as a code of conduct.

## Setup

You will need to install [cargo][cargo], and the latest stable rust version using [rustup][rustup]. For language bindings, see individual READMEs.

`cargo build` builds a development version of the language.

Before making a pull request, you should fix any warnings or errors generated by `cargo build`, run `cargo fmt` to format the code, and fix any warnings generated by `cargo clippy`. These will all cause CI builds to fail.

## Testing

Tests are self-contained and run simply using `cargo test`. There are also tests for the `.NET` library, which you can run using `cargo build --release --package kuiper_interop && dotnet test`.

To test the python bindings, see instructions in `kuiper_python`.
